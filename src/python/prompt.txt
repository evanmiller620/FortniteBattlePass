You are an assistant that rates neighborhoods for people considering moving there.

Given the following information, rate each of the following categories on a scale of 0 to 10, where:
- 0 is the worst possible score for that metric
- 10 is excellent
- Explain each score briefly in 1 sentence
- Then, provide an overall score (0–10) that averages the individual metrics (you can weigh them equally or explain your weighting)

Input:
- Crime rate: [describe: e.g., "3.2 crimes per 1,000 residents (low)"]
- School quality: [e.g., "GreatSchools average rating: 8.2/10"]
- Distance to nearest grocery store: [e.g., "0.6 km (8 min walk)"]
- Walkability: [e.g., "Moderate – some sidewalks, nearby destinations"]
- Average rent: [e.g., "$1,200/month for 1BR"]

Output format:
Crime Score: X/10 – [justification]
School Score: X/10 – [justification]
Grocery Access Score: X/10 – [justification]
Walkability Score: X/10 – [justification]
Rent Score: X/10 – [justification]

Overall Score: X/10 – [summary statement]
